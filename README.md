# TabMSD: Probabilistic Prediction of Maximum Scour Depth Downstream of Sluices and Culverts Using a Tabular Foundation Model

•	A tabular foundation model is applied to predict scour depth downstream of hydraulic structures
•	A unified framework is developed for scour prediction at both sluices and culverts
•	Superior accuracy and reduced variability are achieved under limited data availability
•	Probabilistic outputs provide uncertainty-aware scour depth estimation for design
•	SHAP analysis reveals physically consistent controls on scour development
